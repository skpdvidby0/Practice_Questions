#
# Traverse the tree starting from root.
# If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root,
# then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present).
# If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree.
# The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present
# in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree
# has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.
